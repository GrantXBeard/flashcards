# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Introduction

In this project, we wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line!

## Goals

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub).

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal.

Running `node index.js` from the root should result in the game starting.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.

## Challenges/wins

Wins: This project gave me a much better understanding of class to class interaction.

Challenges: This was my first time writing tests.

## Future Iterations

- Build out another dataset
- Functionality that restarts the game if you score less than a certain percent.
